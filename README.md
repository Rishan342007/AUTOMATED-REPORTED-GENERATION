### üìù **Project Description: Automated Sales Report Generation using Python**

This project is a demonstration of how to automate simple data analysis and reporting tasks using Python. As part of **Task 2** in the internship at **Codetech IT Solutions**, this script was developed by **Rishan N**, a student from **Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology**. The goal of the project is to create a clean, structured, and insightful **Sales Performance Report** without the use of external files like CSV or Excel.

The script uses manually entered data for three key products ‚Äî **Laptop**, **Mobile**, and **Headphones**. For each product, data includes the number of units sold and the total revenue generated. Python's list and dictionary structures are used to store and process this data efficiently.

Key features of this project include:

* **Total Units Sold**: Calculates the sum of all units sold across products.
* **Total Revenue**: Computes the overall revenue generated from all products.
* **Top-Performing Product**: Identifies the product with the highest revenue.
* **Individual Product Breakdown**: Provides unit-wise and revenue-wise performance for each product.

The report is displayed in a clear, console-based output format, making it easy to understand and interpret. It is designed to simulate the logic behind sales dashboards used in real businesses, focusing on automation and clarity.

This kind of automated reporting is highly useful in business scenarios where quick insights are needed without manual calculations. It helps build a foundation for future enhancements like CSV parsing, graphical summaries, and integration with Excel or dashboards.

In summary, this project reflects Rishan‚Äôs ability to apply Python for real-world business tasks, focusing on accuracy, logic, and presentation. It forms an important stepping stone in data-driven decision-making and reporting workflows.
